2.  Fill in EC2 Credentials.

3.  Configure the database, or leave the default sqlite3.

===== Using mod_wsgi =====

1. Setting up your django app

   A. Permissions
      In order for the webserver to access your app, the webserver needs to
      have these permissions.  mysite/ refers to the site's folder.

      * read access on everything
      * rwx mysite
      * rwx mysite/log/
      * Access to read/write to the database.  The default database engine is
        sqlite3, with a default file is mysite/sqlite3.db.

2. Setting up the server

   If you aren't the one setting up the server you don't need to worry about
   this.
