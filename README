===== Setting Up the Installation =====

1.  Copy the file settings.py.sample to settings.py

2.  Fill in EC2 Credentials.

3.  Configure the database, or leave the default sqlite3.

4.  Create database.  The user specified in settings must have permissions for
    this.  Run the command:
     $ python manage.py syncdb

@TODO: More?

===== Reasonable Test Data =====

1. Create an LDAPserver object (url='ldap://ldap.ncsu.edu/', name='NCSU')
2. Create an Application (id = 'ami-b1a24ed8', Max concurrent instances='0', users per smal ='5', cluster headroom='1')
3. Create an Instance (ldap='NCSU')
4. Create a role ( name='cn=ncsu,ou=access,ou=groups,dc=ncsu,dc=edu' )

===== Using mod_wsgi =====

1. Setting up your django app

   A. Permissions
      In order for the webserver to access your app, the webserver needs to
      have these permissions.  mysite/ refers to the site's folder.

      * read access on everything
      * rwx mysite
      * rwx mysite/log/
      * If you're using sqlite, make sure the server has read/write permissions
        to the file.

      Remember that the webserver needs access to whatever path mysite/ is in
      as well.  For example: if your mysite/ directory is in
      /home/username/mysite/ then apache needs rwx permissions to
      /home/username also.

2. Setting up the server

   If you aren't the one setting up the server you don't need to worry about
   this.
